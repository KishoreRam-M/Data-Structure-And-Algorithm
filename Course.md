Great! I’ll find beginner-level free courses with valid certificates that are recognized by MNCs for each of the following areas: Java, Spring Boot, SQL, Java Full Stack Development, Java Backend Development, React, JavaScript, Frontend Development, and Data Structures & Algorithms in Java.

I’ll make sure the courses are from trusted platforms and note any that require a small fee for the certificate. I’ll organize them clearly so it’s easy for you to track and enroll.
I’ll get back to you shortly with the list.
