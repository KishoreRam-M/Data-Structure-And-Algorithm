# Longest Divisible Subset Algorithm: Explained with Enhanced Diagrams

This document explains the "Longest Divisible Subset" problem in detail, focusing on visual clarity with an abundance of diagrams to illustrate each step of the dynamic programming approach. This is the algorithm that likely produces the output `[5, 15]` for the given input array `{51, 7, 6, 5, 88, 4, 81, 15, 74}`.

## Problem Description (Hypothesized)

Given an array of distinct positive integers `nums`, the goal is to find the **largest (longest)** subset `answer` such that for any two elements `(x, y)` within this subset, either `x` is divisible by `y` or `y` is divisible by `x`. In simpler terms, when sorted, the elements of this subset must form a "divisibility chain" (e.g., `a, b, c` where `b % a == 0` and `c % b == 0`). If multiple such longest subsets exist, any one of them is considered a valid solution.

**Example Input and Expected Output:**

  * **Input Array:** `arr = {51, 7, 6, 5, 88, 4, 81, 15, 74}`
  * **Expected Output:** `[5, 15]`
      * This output `[5, 15]` forms a divisibility chain because `15 % 5 == 0`. Another possible chain of the same length is `[4, 88]` (`88 % 4 == 0`). The specific output `[5, 15]` implies a tie-breaking rule, which we'll cover.

## Algorithm: Dynamic Programming Approach

The Longest Divisible Subset problem is a classic application of dynamic programming. The strategy revolves around building up solutions for smaller subproblems to solve the larger problem.

### Key Insight: Sorting Simplifies Divisibility Checks

If we sort the input array `nums` in ascending order, then for any `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` where `j < i`, if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `nums[j]` can precede `nums[i]` in a divisibility chain. We don't need to check `nums[j] % nums[i] == 0` as `nums[j]` would be smaller.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown with Enhanced Diagrams

Let's trace the algorithm with our example: `arr = {51, 7, 6, 5, 88, 4, 81, 15, 74}`

#### Step 1: Sort the Array

First, sort the input array `arr` in ascending order.

**Original Array:**

```
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| 51 | 7  | 6  | 5  | 88 | 4  | 81 | 15 | 74 |
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
```

**Sorted Array (`nums`):**

```
Indices: 0    1    2    3    4     5     6     7     8
       +----+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
nums:  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 15  | 51  | 74  | 81  | 88  |
       +----+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
             Length (n) = 9
```

#### Step 2: Initialize DP Arrays

We'll use two auxiliary arrays:

  * **`dp[i]`**: Stores the **length** of the longest divisible subset that **ends** with `nums[i]`. Initially, every number itself forms a subset of length 1.
  * **`prev[i]`**: Stores the **index** of the element that comes immediately *before* `nums[i]` in the longest divisible subset ending at `nums[i]`. This helps us reconstruct the path. Initially, no element has a predecessor, so we use `-1`.

We also track `maxLength` (the overall longest subset length found so far) and `endIndex` (the index of the last element of that `maxLength` subset).

**Initial State:**

```
Indices: 0    1    2    3    4     5     6     7     8
       +----+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
nums:  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 15  | 51  | 74  | 81  | 88  |
       +----+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
dp:    | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |  (Each number is a subset of length 1)
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

       +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
prev:  | -1 | -1 | -1 | -1 | -1 | -1 | -1 | -1 | -1 |  (No predecessors yet)
       +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

maxLength = 1
endIndex = 0 (points to nums[0] = 4)
```

#### Step 3 & 4: Iterate and Fill DP Arrays / Find Max Length

We'll use nested loops. The outer loop (`i`) iterates through each number in `nums`. The inner loop (`j`) checks all preceding numbers (`nums[j]` where `j < i`).

**Outer Loop (i = 0): `nums[0] = 4`**

  * No `j < i` to check.
  * `dp[0]` remains 1, `prev[0]` remains -1.
  * `maxLength` (1) is not less than `dp[0]` (1). `endIndex` remains 0.

**State after i=0:**

```
Indices: 0    1    2    3    4     5     6     7     8
nums:    4    5    6    7    15    51    74    81    88
dp:      1    1    1    1    1     1     1     1     1
prev:   -1   -1   -1   -1   -1    -1    -1    -1    -1

maxLength = 1, endIndex = 0 (pointing to 4)
```

**Outer Loop (i = 1): `nums[1] = 5`**

  * **Inner Loop (j = 0): `nums[0] = 4`**
      * `nums[1] % nums[0]`: `5 % 4 != 0`. No divisibility.
  * `dp[1]` remains 1, `prev[1]` remains -1.
  * `maxLength` (1) is not less than `dp[1]` (1). `endIndex` remains 0.

**State after i=1:**

```
Indices: 0    1    2    3    4     5     6     7     8
nums:    4    5    6    7    15    51    74    81    88
dp:      1    1    1    1    1     1     1     1     1
prev:   -1   -1   -1   -1   -1    -1    -1    -1    -1

maxLength = 1, endIndex = 0 (pointing to 4)
```

**(Skipping i=2 and i=3 as no divisibility updates occur)**

**Outer Loop (i = 4): `nums[4] = 15`**

  * **Inner Loop (j = 0): `nums[0] = 4`**

      * `15 % 4 != 0`.

  * **Inner Loop (j = 1): `nums[1] = 5`**

      * `15 % 5 == 0`. (Divisible\!)
      * Check `dp[1] + 1` (which is `1 + 1 = 2`) vs. `dp[4]` (which is `1`).
      * `2 > 1`, so update `dp[4] = 2` and `prev[4] = 1`.
      * **Meaning:** The longest divisible subset ending with `15` is now `[5, 15]`.

  * **Inner Loop (j = 2): `nums[2] = 6`**

      * `15 % 6 != 0`.

  * **Inner Loop (j = 3): `nums[3] = 7`**

      * `15 % 7 != 0`.

  * **After inner loop for i=4:** `dp[4]` is now `2`.

      * `dp[4]` (2) is greater than `maxLength` (1).
      * Update `maxLength = 2`, `endIndex = 4`.

**State after i=4:**

```
Indices: 0    1    2    3    4     5     6     7     8
nums:    4    5    6    7    15    51    74    81    88
dp:      1    1    1    1    2     1     1     1     1    <-- dp[4] updated!
prev:   -1   -1   -1   -1    1    -1    -1    -1    -1    <-- prev[4] updated!

maxLength = 2, endIndex = 4 (pointing to 15)
```

**Visualizing the connection:**

```
Original nums: 4  5  6  7  15 ...
                  |      ^
                  |      |
                  --------- This link forms [5, 15] (length 2)
```

**(Skipping i=5, i=6, i=7 as no updates occur that create a longer subset than current `maxLength=2`)**

**Outer Loop (i = 8): `nums[8] = 88`**

  * **Inner Loop (j = 0): `nums[0] = 4`**

      * `88 % 4 == 0`. (Divisible\!)
      * Check `dp[0] + 1` (which is `1 + 1 = 2`) vs. `dp[8]` (which is `1`).
      * `2 > 1`, so update `dp[8] = 2` and `prev[8] = 0`.
      * **Meaning:** A longest divisible subset ending with `88` is now `[4, 88]`.

  * **Inner Loop (j = 1): `nums[1] = 5`**

      * `88 % 5 != 0`.

  * ... (check other `j`s, no further updates to `dp[8]` for larger length)

  * **After inner loop for i=8:** `dp[8]` is now `2`.

      * `dp[8]` (2) is **not** greater than `maxLength` (which is already `2`).
      * **Crucial Point (Tie-Breaking):** Because we use `if (dp[i] > maxLength)`, if another element `nums[i]` yields the *same* `maxLength`, `endIndex` will *not* change. This ensures that if `[5, 15]` was the first `maxLength` subset found, it remains the target for reconstruction. If the condition were `if (dp[i] >= maxLength)`, then `endIndex` would update to `8`, and we would reconstruct `[4, 88]`. The problem statement `Output: [5, 15]` implies the `>` condition or a similar tie-breaking logic.

**Final State after all iterations:**

```
Indices: 0    1    2    3    4     5     6     7     8
nums:    4    5    6    7    15    51    74    81    88
dp:      1    1    1    1    2     1     1     1     2    <-- dp[8] updated!
prev:   -1   -1   -1   -1    1    -1    -1    -1    0     <-- prev[8] updated!

maxLength = 2, endIndex = 4 (still pointing to 15)
```

#### Step 5: Reconstruct the Subset

Now, we use `maxLength` and `endIndex` along with the `prev` array to build our `result` list.

**Starting with `endIndex = 4` (which corresponds to `nums[4] = 15`):**

1.  **Current `endIndex = 4`:**

      * Add `nums[4]` (which is `15`) to `result`. `result = [15]`.
      * Move to predecessor: `endIndex = prev[4]` (which is `1`).

    <!-- end list -->

    ```
    result: [15]
    Current endIndex: 4 (value 15)
    Next endIndex: prev[4] = 1
    ```

2.  **Current `endIndex = 1`:**

      * Add `nums[1]` (which is `5`) to `result`. `result = [15, 5]`.
      * Move to predecessor: `endIndex = prev[1]` (which is `-1`).

    <!-- end list -->

    ```
    result: [15, 5]
    Current endIndex: 1 (value 5)
    Next endIndex: prev[1] = -1
    ```

3.  **Current `endIndex = -1`:**

      * The loop terminates as we've reached the start of the chain.

**Result before reversing:** `[15, 5]`

**Reverse the result to get ascending order:**
`[5, 15]`

**Final Output:** `[5, 15]`

## Complexity Analysis

Let $N$ be the number of elements in the input array `nums`.

  * **Time Complexity:**

      * **Sorting the array:** $O(N \\log N)$
      * **Nested loops for DP calculation:** The outer loop runs $N$ times. The inner loop runs up to $i$ times for each $i$, so roughly $1 + 2 + ... + (N-1)$ operations, which is $O(N^2)$.
      * **Reconstructing the subset:** In the worst case, the longest subset can contain all $N$ elements, so this takes $O(N)$ time.
      * **Overall Time Complexity:** The dominant factor is the nested loops, so the overall time complexity is $\\mathbf{O(N^2)}$.

  * **Space Complexity:**

      * **`dp` array:** $O(N)$
      * **`prev` array:** $O(N)$
      * **`result` list:** In the worst case, the longest divisible subset could contain all $N$ elements, so $O(N)$.
      * **Overall Space Complexity:** $\\mathbf{O(N)}$.

## Summary and Key Concepts Illustrated

  * **Dynamic Programming (DP):** The problem is decomposed into smaller, overlapping subproblems. `dp[i]` stores the optimal solution for the subproblem ending at `nums[i]`. This "memoization" prevents redundant calculations.

    graph TD
        subgraph DP Table Calculation
            A[Start DP] --> B{For each nums[i]};
            B --> C{For each nums[j] (j < i)};
            C -- nums[i] % nums[j] == 0 --> D{Is dp[j]+1 > dp[i]?};
            D -- Yes --> E[Update dp[i] = dp[j]+1, prev[i]=j];
            D -- No --> C;
            E --> C;
            C --> B;
            B --> F[Find max length and endIndex];
            F --> G[End DP Calculation];
        end
    ```

  * **Sorting (`Arrays.sort()`):** Crucial pre-processing step. It transforms the problem from checking divisibility in two directions (`x % y == 0` or `y % x == 0`) to only one direction (`nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` where `j < i`). This simplifies the logic significantly.

    ```
    graph TD
        A[Unsorted Array] --> B[Sort Array];
        B --> C[Sorted Array];
        C -- Divisibility check --> D{nums[i] % nums[j] == 0? (j < i)};
    ```

  * **Divisibility Chain:** The core concept of the problem. Elements within the subset must be sequentially divisible.

    ```
    graph LR
        A["Smallest (e.g., 5)"] --> B["Multiple (e.g., 15)"];
        B --> C["Another Multiple (e.g., 30)"];
    ```

  * **Backtracking (using `prev` array):** After filling the `dp` array, `prev` array acts as a "breadcrumb trail" to reconstruct the actual longest subset, not just its length. It efficiently links elements in the optimal path.

    graph TD
        A[endIndex (e.g., index of 15)] --> B{Add nums[endIndex] to result};
        B --> C[endIndex = prev[endIndex]];
        C -- endIndex != -1 --> A;
        C -- endIndex == -1 --> D[Stop];
        D --> E[Reverse result];
        E --> F[Final Subset];
    ```

  * **Tie-breaking:** As observed in the dry run (`[5, 15]` vs. `[4, 88]`), the choice of `>` vs. `>=` when updating `maxLength` and `endIndex` determines which longest subset is returned if multiple exist. Using `>` ensures the first encountered longest subset (based on sorted order) is chosen.

This comprehensive explanation, heavily augmented with diagrams, should provide a crystal-clear understanding of the Longest Divisible Subset problem and its solution.
