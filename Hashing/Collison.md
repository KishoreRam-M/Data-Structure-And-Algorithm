### **Understanding Collision in Hashing**

#### **1. What is a Collision?**
A **collision** occurs in hashing when two different keys produce the same hash value using a hash function. This means multiple keys are mapped to the same index in the hash table.

#### **Example:**
Using `h(key) = key % 5` as a hash function for table size 5:
- Keys: `10` and `15` both hash to `h(10) = h(15) = 0`.

---

### **2. Causes of Collision**
1. **Poor Hash Function Design**: A non-uniform hash function maps many keys to the same value.
2. **Small Table Size**: When the hash table size is too small relative to the number of keys.
3. **Load Factor**: The ratio of the number of stored elements to the table size. High load factors increase the likelihood of collisions.

---

### **3. Collision Handling Techniques**
When collisions occur, they need to be resolved using one of the following techniques:

---

#### **3.1 Chaining**
- **Idea**: Each index of the hash table stores a linked list (or dynamic data structure). Keys hashing to the same index are appended to the list.

**Example**:
1. Insert keys: `10`, `15`, `20` with `h(key) = key % 5`.
2. Table:
   ```
   Index 0 -> 10 -> 15 -> 20
   Index 1 -> (empty)
   Index 2 -> (empty)
   ...
   ```

**Visualization**:
- `0 -> [10, 15, 20]`
- Simple and dynamic, but requires extra memory for linked lists.

**Pros**:
- Easy to implement.
- Dynamically grows as more collisions occur.

**Cons**:
- Slower lookup in long chains (`O(n)` for worst-case chain length).

---

#### **3.2 Open Addressing**
- **Idea**: Instead of using separate chains, find another open slot in the table.

**Techniques in Open Addressing**:
1. **Linear Probing**:
   - Look for the next empty slot sequentially.
   - Formula: `h'(key) = (h(key) + i) % table_size`, where `i` is the probe count.
   - **Visualization**:
     ```
     Insert keys: 10, 15, 20
     Index 0: 10
     Index 1: 15
     Index 2: 20
     ```
   - **Problem**: Clustering of keys reduces performance.

2. **Quadratic Probing**:
   - Use a quadratic function to find the next empty slot.
   - Formula: `h'(key) = (h(key) + i^2) % table_size`.
   - Reduces clustering compared to linear probing.

3. **Double Hashing**:
   - Use a secondary hash function for probing.
   - Formula: `h'(key) = (h1(key) + i * h2(key)) % table_size`.
   - **Key Idea**: Two hash functions minimize clustering.

---

#### **3.3 Robin Hood Hashing**
- In this approach, keys with longer probe chains can displace keys with shorter chains, ensuring better distribution.

---

#### **3.4 Resizing and Rehashing**
- **When to Resize**: If the load factor exceeds a threshold (commonly 0.7).
- **Process**:
  1. Double the table size.
  2. Rehash all existing keys to the new table.

---

### **4. Choosing a Good Hash Function**
A good hash function is crucial for minimizing collisions.

#### **Properties of a Good Hash Function**:
1. **Deterministic**: Always produces the same output for the same input.
2. **Uniform Distribution**: Spreads keys evenly across the table.
3. **Fast Computation**: Efficient to compute for large datasets.
4. **Minimizes Clustering**: Avoids mapping many keys to the same index.

#### **Examples of Good Hash Functions**:
1. Multiplicative Hashing:
   - `h(key) = floor(m * frac(key * A))`, where `A` is a constant.
2. Polynomial Hashing:
   - `h(key) = Î£ (char[i] * prime^i) % table_size`.

---

### **5. Collision Visualization**

#### **Chaining Visualization**
Insert keys: `10, 15, 20` with table size `5`:
```
Hash Table:
Index 0 -> [10, 15, 20]
Index 1 -> []
Index 2 -> []
Index 3 -> []
Index 4 -> []
```

#### **Open Addressing Visualization**
Insert keys: `10, 15, 20` with linear probing:
```
Initial:
Index 0 -> 10
Index 1 -> (empty)
Index 2 -> (empty)

After 15 (collision at 0):
Index 0 -> 10
Index 1 -> 15

After 20 (collision at 0, 1):
Index 0 -> 10
Index 1 -> 15
Index 2 -> 20
```

### **6. Complexity Analysis**

| Technique         | Time Complexity (Insert/Search/Delete) | Space Complexity |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Chaining**       | Average: `O(1)` | Worst: `O(n)`           | `O(n)` (extra space for chains) |
| **Open Addressing**| Average: `O(1)` | Worst: `O(n)`           | `O(1)`                          |

### **7. Real-World Examples of Collision Handling**
1. **Chaining**: Widely used in hash-based libraries (e.g., Java's `HashMap`).
2. **Open Addressing**: Preferred in memory-constrained environments.

---

### **8. Hashing in Problem Solving**
1. **Frequency Count**:
   - Problem: Count the frequency of elements in an array.
   - Solution: Use a hash table to store counts.
2. **Longest Consecutive Subsequence**:
   - Use a hash set to store elements and check consecutive sequences.
3. **Two Sum Problem**:
   - Use a hash map to store complements for constant-time lookup.

---

### **Summary**
Collisions are inevitable in hashing but can be efficiently managed using techniques like chaining, open addressing, and rehashing. By choosing the right hash function and collision handling strategy, you can achieve excellent performance for search, insert, and delete operations.
